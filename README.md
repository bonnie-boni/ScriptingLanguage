### Running the Scripts

1.  **File Manager**:

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 file_manager.py
    ```

    The script will guide you through the process, prompting for student names and other inputs as needed.

2.  **Student Report Generator**:

    Make sure you have the `students.json` file in the same directory. Then, run the script:

    ```bash
    python3 students_report.py
    ```

    This will generate a `report.csv` file in the same directory.
